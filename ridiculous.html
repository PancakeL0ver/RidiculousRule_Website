			<h1>The Most Ridiculous Rule</h1>
			<p>I once needed a pen. Figured this was a reasonable ask. Went to the supply closet on my floor, which was locked. Asked the floor's admin, she told me to go to the main supply room in the basement. Went to the basement and explained my situation of needing a pen. They told me all requests for supplies must be approved by my department head. </p>
<h2> Awkward Introductions</h2>
<p>	Problem is, being new, I'd never met my department head. She also worked in San Francisco (I worked in Philadelphia), so I needed to send an email both introducing myself, and asking her if I had permission to get a pen from the supply closet.
